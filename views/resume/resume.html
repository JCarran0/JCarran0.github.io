                  * Succesfully balanced a major migration from AngularJS to Angular with the on-time

              * Led release engineering and continuous integration
                * Made progress towards continuous deployment (from 1 deploy every 2 weeks to 3+ deployments

              * Worked closely with Product Team to ensure that features were reasonably scoped to deadlines
                and priorities were clear in terms of "must haves" vs "should haves" vs "nice to haves"

              * Held regular meetings to establish and reinforce team norms around coding style, standards
