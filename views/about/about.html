        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </div>
      <p>My name is Jared Carrano. I'm a full-stack developer at
        <a href="https://www.newvisions.org/">New Visions for Public Schools</a>.
        New Visions is a non-profit organization in New York City dedicated to ensuring all our city's students have access
        to a high quality education that prepares them for work or college and beyond. I'm lucky to be part of a great team
        working to build a robust set of data tools for administrators and teachers in our network of over 250 urban high
        schools.
      </p>
      <p>Besides coding, I really love the great outdoors, though I find myself out there less and less. More typically I'm home binge watching Netflix and generally enjoying hanging with my wife and our brand new baby boy. And our two cats.</p>
